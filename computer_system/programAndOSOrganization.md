# Chapter 2: Program and OS Organization

## Key terms and concepts

## Register

Registers are the smallest data holding elements that are built into the processor itself. These are the memory locations that are directly accessible by the processor. They may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data such as a bit sequence or individual characters. For example, an instruction may specify that the contents of two defined registers be multiplied together and then placed in a specific register.

**Example**: Accumulator register, Program counter, Instruction register, Address register, etc.

## Memory

Memory is a hardware device used to store computer programs, instructions, and data.  
1. **Primary / Main Memory**: 
   - Directly accessible by the CPU.
   - Comprised of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).
   - Provides the actual working space for the processor.
   - Holds data and instructions that the processor is currently working on.
   - Examples include RAM, register, cache, etc.

2. **Secondary Memory / Mass Storage**:
   - Not directly accessible by the CPU.
   - Data from secondary memory needs to be transferred to primary memory before the CPU can access it.
   - Examples include hard drives, SSDs, CDs, DVDs, USB drives, etc.

- **Volatile Memory**: Loses its contents when the computer or hardware device loses power. Example: RAM.
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains its contents even if power is lost. Examples: EPROM, Flash memory.
