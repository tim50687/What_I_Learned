# Tomcat directory structure

## Tomcat's Directory Structure

Tomcat can be installed anywhere on the local system, typically by unzipping a downloaded ZIP file. The top-level directory where Tomcat is installed is referred to as `TOMCAT_HOME`. This directory contains various subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose:

### `TOMCAT_HOME` (Top-Level Directory)
- Contains files like LICENSE, NOTICE, RELEASE-NOTES, and RUNNING.txt.

### Subdirectories within `TOMCAT_HOME`
1. **bin**: Contains scripts to `start/stop` Tomcat and other utility scripts.
2. **conf**: Contains configuration files, typically XML files, for configuring Tomcat.

- server.xml: Configures the Tomcat server, including ports, connectors, and other server-level settings.

3. **lib**: Contains Tomcat and third-party libraries in the form of `JAR` files.

4. **logs**: Contains log files generated by Tomcat during runtime.

- What happend if something goes wrong? Check the logs.

5. **temp**: Stores temporary files created by Tomcat or Java applications using the File API.
6. **webapps**: The directory where `deployed web applications` (WAR files) are placed. Each deployed web application gets its own directory here.
7. **work**: Stores Tomcat-compiled JSP scripts and other temporary assets created during the execution of web applications.

### `TOMCAT_HOME/webapps` Directory
- Acts as the virtual base directory for deployed web applications. For example, if a web application named `preds.war` is deployed, its contents will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/preds`.
- `webapps` can have arbitrarily many subdirectories to any level. For instance, if `preds.war` were deployed to `TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples`, the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/examples/preds`.
- It's recommended to keep web applications directly under `TOMCAT_HOME/webapps` to keep URIs simple.

In summary, the directory structure of Tomcat organizes various components such as configuration files, libraries, logs, deployed web applications, and temporary files in separate directories for efficient management and operation.

### Only install the JVM on production servers
In a production environment, it might be a policy to have only the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed without the full JDK (Java Development Kit) for several reasons:

1. **Security**: By limiting the software installed on production servers to only what is necessary, the attack surface is reduced, which can improve overall security. The JDK includes development tools that may not be needed in a production environment and could potentially be exploited if not properly secured.

2. **Resource Efficiency**: Installing only the JVM reduces the disk space and memory footprint on production servers. Removing unnecessary development tools and libraries helps optimize resource usage, which is crucial for high-performance and scalable applications.

3. **Compliance**: Following industry best practices and compliance standards often involves minimizing software installations to only what is required for the application to function properly. This helps simplify auditing and compliance efforts.

4. **Ease of Maintenance**: Having a minimal installation on production servers makes maintenance and updates easier. It reduces the number of components that need to be monitored, patched, and updated, which can streamline maintenance tasks and reduce the risk of configuration drift.

5. **Performance**: A leaner installation with only the JVM can potentially lead to better performance by reducing overhead and eliminating unnecessary background processes and services that come with a full JDK installation.

6. **Standardization**: Enforcing a policy of having only the JVM installed promotes standardization across production environments. It ensures consistency in the software stack, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot issues.

Overall, limiting the software installed on production servers to only the JVM aligns with security best practices, resource efficiency goals, compliance requirements, and ease of maintenance considerations, ultimately contributing to a more stable and secure production environment.
