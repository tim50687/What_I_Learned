# Tomcar Overview

## Alpha, Beta, and Stable Releases

"Beta," "stable," and "alpha" are terms used to describe different stages of software development and release. They indicate the maturity and stability of a software product. Here's what each term means:

1. **Alpha:** Alpha software is in the early stages of development. It is typically not feature-complete, and it may contain many bugs and issues. Alpha releases are primarily for internal testing by the development team to identify and fix major problems. They are not suitable for general use, and users may encounter crashes and data loss when using alpha software.

2. **Beta:** Beta software is more mature than alpha but still not considered a final release. It usually includes most of the planned features, and the focus shifts from adding new features to fixing bugs and improving stability. Beta versions are often made available to a limited group of users or testers, sometimes called beta testers, who provide feedback and help identify issues. While beta software can still have some bugs, it is closer to being stable and is suitable for broader testing and usage.

3. **Stable:** Stable software is a final, production-ready release. It has undergone extensive testing and bug fixing during the alpha and beta stages, and it is considered reliable and suitable for general use. Stable releases are expected to be free from major issues and are the versions recommended for most users and organizations.

In summary:
- **Alpha** is early, unstable software for internal testing.
- **Beta** is a more mature version for broader testing and feedback.
- **Stable** is the final, reliable release for general use.

Software may also have additional stages like "Release Candidate" (RC), which is a version that is very close to being stable but may undergo final testing before the official stable release. The specific terminology and practices may vary from one software development project to another, but these terms help convey the state of development and the expected reliability of the software.

## Tomcat is written in JAVA

- It executes as an Java application.

- It uses the JVM in the local machine to execute the code.

1. We need to set up the `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the installation directory of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Verified and Unverified Downloads

When downloading software, it is important to ensure that the files are authentic and have not been tampered with. This is especially critical for security-sensitive applications like web servers, which can be targeted by attackers seeking to distribute malicious software.

To help users verify the authenticity of the downloaded files, many software projects provide cryptographic signatures and checksums. These can be used to confirm that the files have not been altered and were indeed created by the developers.

> we can use openssl sha512 to verify the file.

## Put tomcat under a user

Placing a web server, such as Apache Tomcat, under a user's home directory can help mitigate some privilege and security issues, but it's important to understand the trade-offs and limitations involved in doing so. Here are some reasons why one might consider putting a server under a user directory:

1. **User-Level Control:** When you place a server under a user's home directory, that user has full control over the server's configuration and files. This can be beneficial in situations where users need to experiment with or run their web applications without interfering with the system-wide configuration or other users' setups.

2. **Reduced Privilege:** By running the server as a regular user instead of a superuser (like root), you reduce the potential impact of security vulnerabilities. If the server is compromised, the attacker has limited access to the user's files and resources, rather than full system access.

3. **Isolation:** Placing the server under a user directory can help isolate web applications and server configurations. This can be useful in shared hosting environments where multiple users run their web applications on the same server.

However, there are several important considerations and limitations to keep in mind:

1. **Port Accessibility:** Servers running in user directories may not have permission to bind to lower-numbered ports (e.g., ports below 1024), which are typically reserved for system services. This can affect the server's ability to serve HTTP on the standard port 80 or HTTPS on port 443 without additional configuration.

2. **Security Responsibility:** While running the server as a non-privileged user reduces some security risks, it doesn't eliminate them. Users are still responsible for securing their server configurations, keeping software up to date, and following best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

3. **Performance:** Servers running under a user directory may have limited access to system resources compared to system-wide installations. This can impact performance and scalability for high-traffic applications.

4. **Maintenance Complexity:** Managing user-specific server instances can be more complex than having a centralized system-wide installation. It requires users to handle their server updates, configurations, and maintenance.

In summary, placing a web server under a user's home directory can be a practical approach for development, experimentation, or shared hosting scenarios. However, it's essential to weigh the benefits against the limitations and carefully consider the security and performance implications. In production environments or for applications with higher demands, a system-wide installation and proper privilege management are often preferred.
