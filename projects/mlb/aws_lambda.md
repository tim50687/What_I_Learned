### Same Repository or Different Repository?

#### Same Repository:
Keeping everything in a single repository has the benefit of simpler management and easier context switching for developers. It also makes sense for smaller projects or when the backend and frontend are tightly coupled.

#### Different Repository:
Using separate repositories can provide better separation of concerns, making it easier to manage, deploy, and scale each component independently. This is often preferred for larger projects or when different teams manage the frontend and backend.

### Recommendation for Your Case:
Given your setup, where AWS Lambda functions handle the backend tasks and Vercel hosts your Flask frontend, it's reasonable to use separate repositories. This allows you to manage, deploy, and scale your backend services and frontend independently.

### Steps for Each Approach:

#### 1. **Separate Repositories:**

**Backend Repository (for Lambda functions):**
1. **Create a repository named `lambda-functions`.**
2. **Structure:**
    ```
    lambda-functions/
    ├── fetch_stats.py
    ├── fetch_odds.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── serverless.yml (if using Serverless Framework)
    ```
3. **Set Up Serverless Framework:**
    - `serverless.yml` configuration.
4. **Deploy Lambda Functions:**
    ```sh
    npm install -g serverless
    cd lambda-functions
    sls deploy
    ```

**Frontend Repository (for Flask application):**
1. **Create a repository named `flask-app`.**
2. **Structure:**
    ```
    flask-app/
    ├── app.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── templates/
    └── static/
    ```
3. **Create `vercel.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "version": 2,
      "builds": [
        {
          "src": "app.py",
          "use": "@vercel/python"
        }
      ],
      "routes": [
        {
          "src": "/(.*)",
          "dest": "/app.py"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
4. **Deploy to Vercel:**
    ```sh
    npm install -g vercel
    cd flask-app
    vercel
    ```

#### 2. **Single Repository:**

If you decide to keep everything in a single repository, you can structure your project as follows:

**Project Structure:**
```
project/
├── lambda_functions/
│   ├── fetch_stats.py
│   ├── fetch_odds.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── serverless.yml
├── flask_app/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── templates/
│   └── static/
└── vercel.json
```

**Steps:**

1. **Lambda Functions Deployment:**
    - Navigate to `lambda_functions` directory.
    ```sh
    cd project/lambda_functions
    npm install -g serverless
    sls deploy
    ```

2. **Flask Application Deployment:**
    - Navigate to `flask_app` directory.
    ```sh
    cd project/flask_app
    npm install -g vercel
    vercel
    ```

**`vercel.json` in the root directory:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "flask_app/app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/flask_app/app.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Conclusion

Both approaches are valid, but using separate repositories is generally more scalable and maintainable, especially as your project grows. This method also aligns well with the serverless architecture and microservices approach.

If you choose to use separate repositories:
1. **Create two separate repositories.**
2. **Deploy the Lambda functions from one repository.**
3. **Deploy the Flask application from another repository.**

If you choose to use a single repository:
1. **Structure your project directory to separate Lambda functions and Flask application.**
2. **Deploy Lambda functions and Flask application independently from the same repository.**

Choose the approach that best fits your workflow and project requirements. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
