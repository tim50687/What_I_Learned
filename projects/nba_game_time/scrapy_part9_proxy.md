# Proxy 

Even though we change the user agent, the website can still detect that we are using a bot. So we need to use a proxy to hide our IP address.

## Three ways to use proxy

- free proxy list 

- geonode.com/free-proxy-list
    - many people use the same proxy, so it is not stable.
    - might be blocked by the website, because many people use the same proxy.

> but we still use this method in this tutorial.


- paid proxy service
    - more stable
    - less likely to be blocked by the website
    - but it is not free
