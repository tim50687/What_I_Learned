# Fake user agent

User-Agent: Tells a website what kind of browser and operating system you are using. Some websites will block your request if they find out you are using a crawler. To avoid this, we can use a fake user agent.

They might also look at IP address, so we can use a proxy to avoid this.

They will add some cookies, session id, or other information to the request header. We can use a cookie pool to avoid this.

> However, in the more complicated websites, they might use some more advanced techniques to detect crawlers. For example, they might use JavaScript to detect the mouse movement, or they might use some machine learning techniques to detect the pattern of the requests. In this case, we might need to use some more advanced techniques to avoid being detected.

## Implement different user agent

you can set user agent in setting, but this is not what we want to do. We want to randomly select a user agent from a list of user agents.


- create a user agent list

```python
user_agents = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; Pixel 4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko"
]
```

> However, this is too simple. We can use some libraries to generate a random user agent.

### Implement middleware

#### What is middleware

Middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s request/response processing. It’s a light, low-level system for globally altering Scrapy’s requests and responses. 

Certainly! In the provided code, we have a custom middleware class named `ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware` that is designed to interact with the ScrapeOps service to obtain fake user-agent strings for web scraping. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

### Middleware in Scrapy:
Middleware in Scrapy is a set of components that can be used to process requests and responses globally before they reach the spiders or after they are sent by spiders. It allows you to perform various operations on requests and responses, such as modifying headers, handling proxies, or adding custom logic.

### `@classmethod from_crawler` Method:
This is a class method that is used to create an instance of the `ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware` class. It takes the `crawler` object as a parameter, which contains settings and configurations for the Scrapy spider.

### `__init__` Method:
The constructor of the `ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware` class is where the initialization and configuration of the middleware take place. Let's break down the attributes and methods used within the constructor:

- `self.scrapeops_api_key`: It stores the ScrapeOps API key retrieved from Scrapy settings.
- `self.scrapeops_endpoint`: It stores the ScrapeOps endpoint URL retrieved from Scrapy settings.
- `self.scrapeops_fake_user_agent`: It stores a boolean flag indicating whether to use fake user-agents from ScrapeOps, retrieved from Scrapy settings.
- `self.scrapeops_num_results`: It stores the number of user-agents to retrieve from ScrapeOps, if specified in Scrapy settings.
- `self.headers_list`: This list will store the user-agent strings obtained from ScrapeOps.
- `self.__get_user_agents_list()`: This private method is called to fetch user-agent strings from ScrapeOps and populate `self.headers_list`.
- `self._scrapeops_fake_user_agents_enabled()`: This private method is called to check if fake user-agents from ScrapeOps are enabled.

### Private Methods:
- `__get_user_agents_list()`: This method fetches user-agent strings from the ScrapeOps service using the provided API key, endpoint, and optional number of results. The retrieved user-agents are stored in `self.headers_list`.
- `_scrapeops_fake_user_agents_enabled()`: This method checks if the `self.scrapeops_fake_user_agent` flag is set to True, indicating that ScrapeOps fake user-agents should be used. If enabled, it registers the middleware to modify requests with fake user-agents.

In summary, this middleware is responsible for fetching fake user-agent strings from ScrapeOps, and when enabled, it modifies requests to use these user-agents. This allows for improved anonymity and flexibility in web scraping by rotating user-agents during requests.

#### cls()
In the context of Python, `cls()` is a call to the constructor of a class. When you see `cls()` being used, it means that it's creating an instance (object) of the class whose constructor is being called. The `cls` parameter in the `from_crawler` class method represents the class itself, and calling `cls(crawler.settings)` creates an instance of the class `cls` (which is `ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware` in this case) and passes `crawler.settings` as a parameter to the constructor of that class.

In simpler terms, it's a way to create an object of the class `ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware` with specific settings and configurations based on `crawler.settings`. The constructor of the class (`__init__`) is responsible for initializing the object with the provided settings.

#### process_request()

This function is a part of a middleware in Python, typically used in web scraping frameworks like Scrapy. In this context:

- `process_request`: This is a method that gets called automatically by Scrapy for each outgoing HTTP request made by the spider.

- `self.scrapeops_fake_user_agent_active`: This appears to be a condition to check if a specific setting (presumably related to fake user agents) is active or enabled. The exact logic behind this setting would depend on the broader context of your web scraping project and how it's configured.

- `self._get_random_user_agent()`: This is a method call that appears to retrieve a random user agent string. User agents are used in HTTP requests to identify the client making the request. In web scraping, using random user agents can help mimic different web browsers or client applications to avoid detection and blocking by websites.

- `request.headers['User-Agent'] = random_user_agent`: If the condition `self.scrapeops_fake_user_agent_active` is met, this line of code assigns a randomly selected user agent (retrieved from `self._get_random_user_agent()`) to the 'User-Agent' header of the outgoing HTTP request. This can be used to make the web scraping bot's requests appear more like requests from real users, improving the chances of successful scraping without being blocked by websites.

Overall, this function is responsible for dynamically setting the 'User-Agent' header of outgoing requests based on certain conditions, which is a common practice in web scraping to avoid being detected as a bot by websites.


### Middleware in Scrapy

The commented-out sections in the Scrapy settings file relate to enabling or disabling spider middlewares and downloader middlewares. Here's an explanation of these two sections:

1. Spider Middlewares (SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES):
   - Spider middlewares are components in Scrapy that allow you to process requests and responses at the spider level. They can be used to manipulate the behavior of specific spiders.
   - The commented-out code is an example of how to configure spider middlewares. In this example, the 'bookstore.middlewares.BookstoreSpiderMiddleware' middleware is mentioned with a priority of 543.
   - The priority number determines the order in which multiple middlewares are applied. Lower numbers indicate higher priority, so a middleware with a priority of 543 will be executed before one with a priority of 544.
   - By commenting out the middleware in this section, you are effectively disabling it for the spider(s) that use this Scrapy project.

2. Downloader Middlewares (DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES):
   - Downloader middlewares, on the other hand, are used to process requests and responses at the lower level of Scrapy's request/response handling. They are responsible for things like handling user agents, handling cookies, and more.
   - In the commented-out code, there are two downloader middlewares listed:
     - 'bookstore.middlewares.BookstoreDownloaderMiddleware' with a priority of 543 (disabled).
     - 'bookstore.middlewares.ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware' with a priority of 544 (enabled).
   - The priority order still applies, so the 'ScrapeOpsFakeUserAgentMiddleware' will be executed after any other middleware with a lower priority.
   - By commenting out the middleware you don't want to use, you can enable or disable them as needed for your spider(s).

In both sections, you can control the behavior of middlewares by specifying their priority and enabling or disabling them based on your requirements.

### Robots.txt

Robots.txt is a text file that is placed in the root directory of a website to tell web crawlers which pages and files the crawler can or cannot request from the website. It is used mainly to avoid overloading the website with requests and to avoid being blocked by the website.
