## 328. Odd Even Linked List *

> The reason we need to handle both odd and even nodes together is to maintain the correct linking of nodes without breaking the structure of the list. If you were to process `all odd nodes first` and `then separately process the even nodes`, while doing even nodes, the `pointers would get messed up`.
