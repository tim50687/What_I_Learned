A URL (Uniform Resource Location) is a way to locate resources in the Internet. Resources can be:

* Web pages (HTML documents)
* Images
* Video files
* Fonts
* ...

**Client-Server model**

The web works on a `client-server model`. The client is the browser, and the server is the computer or computers that host our target website. The client requests a service, and the server provides that service.

The message that the client requests is formatted based on a protocol called HTTP. HTTP is a language that clients and servers use to talk to each other. We also have HTTPS, which is HTTP with encryption.
